## Why integrate GitHub with Jenkins
* You can and should use Jenkins with GitHub to save time and keep your project up-to-date. One of the basic steps of implementing CI/CD is integrating your SCM (Source Control Management) tool with your CI tool. This saves you time and keeps your project updated all the time
#
## Benefits:
* Jenkins creates workflows using Declarative Pipelines, which are similar to GitHub Actions workflow files. Jenkins uses stages to run a collection of steps, while GitHub Actions uses jobs to group one or more steps or individual commands. Jenkins and GitHub Actions support container-based builds.
* Each commit can be traced back to its respective workitem at any given point in time from GitHub itself.
* Enforced checkpoints ensure that no mandatory steps/checks are missed while making a commit â€“ this leads to high success rate for commits.
